Imagine you're helping a friend set a new passcode for their smartphone. They want 
something easy to remember but secure. Your task is to write a program that checks 
if the proposed passcode meets a specific rule: "All digits of the passcode must be 
in ascending or descending order.

Instructions:

Write a Python program that takes a three-digit integer as input (the proposed 
                                        passcode) and checks if it follows the rule:

If the digits are in ascending order (e.g., 123, 567), the program should 
    print "Passcode accepted."
If the digits are in descending order (e.g., 321, 987), the program should 
    also print "Passcode accepted."
If the digits are not in ascending or descending order (e.g., 132, 456), 
    the program should print "Passcode rejected."

Imagine you have three friends: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Each of them has
 a different age, represented by the integers A, B, and C. You want to 
 find out if Bob's age (B) falls between Alice's age (A) and Carol's 
 age (C). Write a program to help you check this.

**Exercise: Finding Positivity in a Group**

You have three friends, Alice, Bob, and Carol. Each of them has some candies, 
and you want to check if at least one of them has some candies left. Here's 
how you can modify the exercise:

**Problem Statement:**

You are given the number of candies each of your friends has:

- Alice has A candies.
- Bob has B candies.
- Carol has C candies.

Write a program that checks the following proposition: "At least one of 
your friends, Alice, Bob, or Carol, has some candies left."

**Example Input/Output:**

- If Alice has 0 candies, Bob has -2 candies, and Carol has 3 candies, 
the program should output: "At least one friend has candies left."

- If Alice has -1 candies, Bob has 0 candies, and Carol has -2 candies, 
the program should output: "No friend has candies left."

This way, the exercise becomes more engaging by using a scenario that 
teenagers can relate to, making it more interesting and relatable.'
